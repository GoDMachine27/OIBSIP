    He was also the youngest Indian freedom fighter hanged at a young age of 23. He enjoys the status of
    a hero among Indian youths and Diaspora.Bhagat Singh belonged to a family of freedom fighters and 
    patriots. His father, grandfather, and uncles were associated with Ghadar Movement, which was a 
    movement mostly by Punjabis to out throw the British from India. His family disapproved of any kind 
    of association with the British Government and actively participated in freedom movements. Birth of

    Revenge of Lala Lajpat Rai’s Death

    On 30th October 1928 when Lala Lajpat Rai was leading a march against the Simon Commission, he was 
    lathi-charged by then Superintendent of Police James Scott. Rai was severely injured and later succumbed
     to the injuries. The incident had prompted Bhagat Singh to take revenge of Lalaji’s death.

    Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Chandrasekhar Azad planned to kill Scott. They killed a probationary Police officer 
    Saunders instead, in a case of mistaken identity. However, after the incident, they c laimed Saunders as 
    their actual target and evaded arrest by changing identities.In the year 1928, the British government held the Simon Commission for the discussion of autonomy for the Indians. It boycotted by several Indian political organizations as the event did not include any Indian representative. Lala Lajpat Rai protested against the same by leading a procession and marching towards the Lahore station. In an attempt to control the mob, the police used the weapon of lathi charge and brutally hit the protestors. Lala Lajpat Rai got severely injured and hospitalised. He succumbed to his injuries a few weeks later. The incident left Bhagat Singh enraged and he planned to avenge Rai’s death. Singh killed British police officer John P. Saunders soon after. He and one of his associates later bombed the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi. He then confessed his involvement in the incident and surrendered to the police.

During the trial period, Bhagat Singh led hunger strike in the prison. He and his co-conspirators, Rajguru and Sukhdev executed on the 23rd of March 1931.

    the Lahore Conspiracy Case. The three were handed death sentences and were ordered to be hanged on 24th 
    March 1931.Fearing public outcry and resentment, the authorities hanged them 11 hours before, that is, on 
    the night of 23rd March 1931. Their bodies were secretly taken out and cremated on the bank of River Sutlej.
    Their ashes were thrown in the river.Bhagat Singh was a freedom fighter with exceptional courage and patriotism.
     He was only 23 when hanged. He left a legacy like no other freedom fighter and is a revered figure among the 
     youths of India.Bhagat Singh was a true patriot. He did not only fight for the freedom of the country but had 
     no qualms giving away his life in the event. His death brought about mixed emotions throughout the country. While
      those who believed in the Gandhian ideology felt that he was too aggressive and radical and hurt the freedom quest
     on the other hands his followers considered him a martyr. He still remembered as Shaheed Bhagat Singh.
